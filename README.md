# Recipe-Book
This Python application helps users that need to find a new recipe based on what's left on the fridge. The app works like this:

Python loads the .json file. For this example I manually created one, containing 3 recipes.The app searches through the collection and if there is an ingredient that is a match, it will provide the following information:

1.Main and Side Ingredients

2.Cooking steps

3.Nutritional values per 100g

If there is no ingredient that is a match within the recipes' main ingredients, the app will type all the available main ingredients from the 3 recipes in case there was a typo
